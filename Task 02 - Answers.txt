01. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increases?

As the number of hidden nodes increases, the accuracy improves, but the improvement becomes smaller after a certain point. If too many hidden nodes are added, the model might become overly complex and could start to overfit.

02. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

The accuracy of the chart improves as the number of hidden nodes increases, however the improvement becomes smaller after a certain point. This shows that adding more hidden nodes gives better results initially, but after a while, the accuracy doesn’t change much. Furthermore, there’s a limit to how much adding more nodes can help the model, adding too many hidden nodes could result with the model becoming overly complex and could start to overfit
